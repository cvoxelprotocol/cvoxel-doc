You can issue your C-Voxel by executing really easy steps.

1. **Add your work summary** to your existing transaction on C-Voxel App and claim it with signature. At the time, a Semi C-Voxel will be created.
2. **Just Ask for a sign to payer** of the transaction via discord, e-mail and twitter etc...
3. **Thatâ€™s it!** Once the payer signs, you get your own C-Voxel!
